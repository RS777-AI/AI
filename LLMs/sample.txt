Life, also known asbiota, refers tomatterthat hasbiological processes, such assignalingand self-sustaining processes. It is defined descriptively by the capacity forhomeostasis,organisation,metabolism,growth,adaptation, response tostimuli, andreproduction. All life over time eventually reaches a state ofdeath, and none isimmortal. Many philosophical definitions ofliving systemshave been proposed, such asself-organizingsystems.Virusesin particular make definition difficult as they replicate only inhostcells. Life exists all over the Earth in air, water, andsoil, with manyecosystemsforming thebiosphere. Some of these are harsh environments occupied only byextremophiles.Life has been studied since ancient times, with theories such asEmpedocles'smaterialismasserting that it was composed offour eternal elements, andAristotle'shylomorphismasserting that living things havesoulsand embody bothformand matter.Life originatedat least 3.5Â billion years ago, resulting in auniversal common ancestor. This evolved into all thespeciesthat exist now, by way of manyextinctspecies, some of which have left traces asfossils. Attempts to classify living things, too,began with Aristotle. Modernclassificationbegan withCarl Linnaeus's system ofbinomial nomenclaturein the 1740s.Living things are composed ofbiochemical molecules, formed mainly from a few corechemical elements. All living things contain two types of large molecule,proteinsandnucleic acids, the latter usually bothDNAandRNA: these carry the information needed by each species, including the instructions to make each type of protein. The proteins, in turn, serve as the machinery which carries out the many chemical processes of life. Thecellis the structural and functional unit of life. Smaller organisms, includingprokaryotes(bacteria andarchaea), consist of small single cells. Largerorganisms, mainlyeukaryotes, can consist of single cells or may bemulticellularwith more complex structure. Life is only known to exist on Earth butextraterrestrial lifeisthought probable.Artificial lifeis being simulated and explored by scientists and engineers.
